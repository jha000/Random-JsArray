# Real-Time Array Graph

A React Native app that generates a random JavaScript array and plots the values in a graph in real-time.

## Description

This app generates a random JavaScript array with a size between 45 and 60 and random values ranging from 0 to 6000. The values are plotted on a graph using the `react-native-chart-kit` library. The graph updates every second with a new randomly selected array value.
